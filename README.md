# Convert Azure Pipelines YAML to GitHub Actions YAML 
A project to create a conversion tool to make conversions between Azure Pipelines YAML and GitHub Actions YAML.

As GitHub Actions becomes more popular, it's clear that a migration tool will be useful to move workloads to GitHub. 

Currently this only supports migrations from Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions.
